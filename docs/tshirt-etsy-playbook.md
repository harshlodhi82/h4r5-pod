---

## 0) TL;DR ‚Äî Do This First

1. **Pick a niche** ‚Üí write 3 buyer intents (e.g., ‚Äúfunny teacher shirt‚Äù, ‚Äúcustom year shirt‚Äù, ‚Äúmatching family shirts‚Äù).
2. **Launch 12 discovery listings** (4 per intent): unique designs + distinct photos.
3. **Front-load the exact long-tail** in the title; mirror in tags + attributes; add a 5‚Äì15s video (silent).
4. **Free shipping logic** (e.g., US Free Shipping Guarantee on \$35+); bake shipping into price.
5. **Turn on Share & Save** and use your trackable link everywhere you post (IG/Pin/YouTube).
6. **Enable Printify Order Routing** with a small max extra-cost cap; prefer providers near buyers.
7. **Check weekly metrics** (CTR, conversion, favorites, ATCs, messages). Double-down with **+6 listings** on winners by weeks 3‚Äì4.
8. **Star Seller habits**: fast replies, on-time dispatch, clear policies, consistent reviews.

---

  **Takeaway:** one **clear intent per listing**; make clicking + buying effortless.

---

* **About**: who you are, what you make, why it‚Äôs special (3‚Äì5 lines).
* **FAQ:** sizing/fit, care, personalization rules, processing times, reprints/returns.

* **Announcement:** promos, last-order dates.
* **Visual consistency:** same lighting/backgrounds; real-world/model shots.

---

## 4) Listing Plan by Niche

**Phase 1 ‚Äî Discovery (Days 1‚Äì14)**
‚Ä¢ 12 listings: choose **3 intents**, create **4 unique** listings per intent.
‚Ä¢ Keep **size/color as variations** so reviews/favorites consolidate.

**Phase 2 ‚Äî Double-Down (Weeks 3‚Äì4)**
‚Ä¢ Add **+6 listings** to the **2‚Äì3 best** intents (views/favorites/ATCs).
‚Ä¢ Expand to longer phrases (e.g., ‚Äúfunny teacher shirt‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äúfunny teacher t-shirt for 3rd grade‚Äù).

**Phase 3 ‚Äî Scale (Month 2+)**
‚Ä¢ Grow to **30‚Äì50 listings per niche**. Each must be meaningfully different (design/intent/audience). Avoid near duplicates.

---

## 5) SEO: Titles, Tags, Categories, Attributes

**Title formula (front-load the primary phrase; human-readable, not salad):**

```
{Primary long-tail} ‚Äì {Recipient/Occasion} | {Important Tags} | {Fit/Fabric/Style} | {Personalized/Year}
```

**Example:**
`Custom Year Shirt ‚Äì 1995 Birthday Gift for Men | 1995 t-shirt, personalized year tee, retro | Unisex Fit Cotton/Poly | Optional Name`

**Tags (use all 13; \~20 chars each; no commas inside one tag):**

```
1995 shirt, custom year tee, retro birthday shirt, unisex t-shirt, gift for him,
teacher shirt, matching family shirts, soft cotton tee, graphic tee,
dad birthday shirt, mom life shirt, printed t-shirt, gift under 30
```

**Categories & attributes (don‚Äôt skip):**
‚Ä¢ **Clothing ‚Üí Tops & Tees ‚Üí T-Shirts**
‚Ä¢ **Recipient** (men/women/unisex), **Occasion/Holiday**, **Material** (cotton/poly), **Fit** (unisex), **Sleeve length**, **Neckline**, **Pattern**, **Primary color**, **Production method** (DTG/DTF), **Personalized** (if applicable).

> Tip: attributes act like extra tags.

**Production Partners (Compliance):** Add Printify + your role (‚ÄúI design; partner prints & ships‚Äù).

**Personalization field:** Turn it on when applicable so buyers see an input box (policy + conversion boost).

**Alt text:** Add image alt text for accessibility (minor SEO win).

---

## 6) Photos & Video (clicks + conversion)

1. **Hero:** flat-lay or model on neutral background; clear design at thumbnail size.
2. **Lifestyle:** real-world scene (classroom, gym, couch).
3. **Fit & size guide:** on-body front/back; include a simple size chart image.
4. **Detail:** close-up of print texture (DTG/DTF) and collar/hem.
5. **Color options:** quick grid (note Heather vs Solid).
6. **Personalization:** where text goes + example.
   **Video (5‚Äì15s):** quick spin or on-body clip; show personalization area.

**Specs:** 2000px+ long side, \~5:4 aspect; keep text legible at thumbnail.
