# Etsy 2025 Playbook ‚Äî Mugs (Printify Seller)

**Goal:** rank for buyer intents, convert with clear media, and keep ceramic ops tight.

---

## 0) TL;DR ‚Äî Do This First

1. **Pick a niche** ‚Üí 3 intents (e.g., ‚Äú1995 mug‚Äù, ‚Äúcustom name mug‚Äù, ‚Äúdad birthday mug‚Äù).
2. **Launch 12 discovery listings** (4 per intent): unique designs + distinct photos.
3. **Front-load the long-tail** in the title; mirror in tags + attributes; add a 5‚Äì15s video.
4. **Free shipping logic** (US \$35+); bake shipping into price.
5. **Turn on Share & Save** and use your trackable link on socials.
6. **Enable Order Routing** with a small max extra-cost cap; prefer nearby providers.
7. **Check weekly metrics**; add **+6 listings** to top intents by weeks 3‚Äì4.
8. **Star Seller behaviors**: fast replies, on-time dispatch, clear policies.

## 1) Metrics / 2) Search / 3) Branding

Same as the T-Shirt playbook, plus mug-specific notes below.

---

## 4) Listing Plan by Niche

Same cadence (12 ‚Üí +6 ‚Üí 30‚Äì50). Keep **capacity/color** as variations so reviews consolidate.

---

## 5) SEO: Titles, Tags, Categories, Attributes

**Title formula**

```
{Primary long-tail} ‚Äì {Recipient/Occasion} | {Important Tags} | {Material/Capacity/Style} | {Personalized/Year/Name}
```

**Example:**

4. **Personalization:** where to enter text + example.
5. **Packaging:** ‚Äúgift-ready‚Äù foam/box (if supported).
6. **Orientation:** show left/right-hand views if design placement matters.

---

## 8) Reviews & Social Proof

Same flow; encourage a photo of the mug in use. Feature UGC with permission.

---

## 9) Messages & Customer Service

Same templates as T-Shirts. Add one more for breakage:

* **SKU hygiene:**
  `MUG-{Design}-{Capacity}-{Color}-{Side}` (e.g., `MUG-1995-15oz-White-Right`).

| ------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High views, low CTR       | Thumbnail/title weak | Swap hero; add lifestyle; clarify 11oz/15oz; overlay ‚ÄúAdd Name‚Äù         |

| Same Qs repeat            | Info missing         | Add answer to description, FAQ, and an image                            |

## 16) IP & Safety Checklist

Identical to T-Shirts: trademark search, no protected marks/characters/likenesses, state buyer-content must be IP-safe, only claim features your provider lists.

---

## 17) Troubleshooting ‚ÄúNo Views‚Äù (quick hits)

* Title too generic ‚Üí front-load the exact phrase buyers type.
* Missing attributes ‚Üí fill every relevant field.
* Weak hero photo ‚Üí reshoot on white; add lifestyle as photo #2.
* No video ‚Üí add a quick 7‚Äì12s demo.
* Not using Share & Save links ‚Üí add to bios & posts.
* Slow replies/late shipping ‚Üí hurts visibility; fix ops first.
