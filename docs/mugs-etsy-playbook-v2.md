# Mug Shop README (Lean & Current)

**What Etsy rewards (in plain English):**

* First, search **matches** your keywords across **titles, tags, categories, attributes, and descriptions**.
* Then it **ranks** based on relevance + how likely your listing is to convert (great photos, strong service record, etc.). Your **Search Visibility** page shows personalized to-dos—check it weekly. 

---

## 1) Weekly Operating Loop (≤60 min)

1. **Search Visibility sweep (15 min):** Do 1–2 fixes (missing attributes, weak photos, unclear policies). 
2. **Titles (15 min):** Rewrite 3 listings to Etsy’s 2025 style (see §3).
3. **Tags & descriptions (20 min):** Use all **13** tags with **unique long-tails** (don’t duplicate categories/attributes); add 1–2 key phrases naturally in the first description lines. 
4. **Customer experience pass (10 min):** Ship on time, reply fast—these signals support ranking.

## 2) How to Find Mug Niches (fast research loop)

**A. Spark ideas (5–10 min):**

* Personalization (names/years), occupations (teacher/nurse), pets/breeds, life events (bridal party/graduation), aesthetics (matte black, speckled stoneware), functional twists (15–20oz, with lid).
* Keep it **IP-safe** (no logos/characters).

**B. Validate demand (10–15 min):**

* Type seed phrases (e.g., *custom name mug*, *teacher mug*, *beagle mug*) and note **autocomplete suggestions**.
* Open the **Mugs** category; list every **attribute** you can truthfully fill (material, capacity, color/finish, personalization, occasion/recipient). **Categories & attributes count like keywords**—use them. 

**C. Spot gaps (10–15 min):**

* Check top results: sizes offered, finishes, price bands, first-photo style.
* List what’s **missing** (under-served breed/occupation, larger size, bundle sets).

**D. Commit (5 min):**

* Choose **one specific long-tail** (e.g., *personalized teacher mug 15 oz*), then build the listing with §3.

## 3) Listing Blueprint (what to do every time)

### Titles — 2025 Etsy guidance

**Write short, scannable titles** that start with what it is, then 1–3 key traits. Avoid keyword lists. Word order doesn’t boost rank; clarity does.
**Formula:** `[Noun]: [Top trait 1], [Top trait 2], [Top trait 3]` (aim ≤ \~15 words).
Use recipient/occasion only if it **defines** the item—otherwise move to tags/attributes.

**Examples (edit to fit yours):**

* `Custom name mug: ceramic, 11–15 oz`
* `1995 year mug: retro numerals, 11–15 oz`
* `Dad birthday mug: matte black, 15 oz`
* `Dog breed line art mug: Beagle, 11 oz`
* `Stoneware coffee mug: speckled glaze, 12 oz`

### Tags — use all 13 (no duplicates)

* Multi-word, **long-tail** phrases + **synonyms/regional** terms (e.g., “coffee cup”, “personalised mug”).
* **Don’t repeat** what’s already covered by your category/attributes (e.g., capacity/color).
* No misspellings; use your shop language. 

**Tag bank (mix to 13 without duplicating attributes):**
`custom name mug, personalized coffee cup, monogram mug, dad gift mug, father birthday mug, 1995 birthday mug, custom year mug, retro numbers mug, beagle dog mug, dog mom mug, pet portrait mug, matte black mug, coffee lover gift`

### Categories & attributes — fill everything relevant

Choose the **most specific** category and complete **all** attributes (material, capacity, finish/color, personalization available, recipient/occasion, dishwasher/microwave when offered). These expand your matching power without burning tag slots. 

### Description — first 2–3 sentences matter

Write naturally; include 1–2 key phrases near the top (no keyword dump). Etsy **reads descriptions** for matching.
**Starter:** “Personalized ceramic mug with **\[name/year]**, available in **11 or 15 oz**. Durable print; **dishwasher/microwave** per listing. Enter personalization exactly as to be printed.” 

### Photos / Video

* **Hero**: clear, legible design (mobile-first).
* Gallery: in-hand scale, inside/handle close-ups, back side, lifestyle, **personalization example**, packaging.
* Short **5–15s** spin or personalization demo.
  (Strong media improves conversion, which helps ranking.) 

---

## 4) Launch Cadence (simple & repeatable)

* Pick **2–3 niches** → launch **12 discovery listings** (distinct designs/photos).
* In weeks 3–4, double-down on the top intent with **+6** refined listings.
* Keep variations (e.g., **11oz/15oz**) under one listing so reviews consolidate.

*(This cadence feeds Etsy enough data to learn your winners while keeping ops focused.)*

---

## 5) Holiday Rhythm (Aug–Dec)

* **Now:** tighten foundations (titles, tags, attributes, photos), validate 1–2 giftable mug lines (e.g., teacher, pets, zodiac).
* **Next months:** follow Etsy’s **2025 Holiday Checklist** drops for time-specific tasks and reminders. 

---

## 6) Operations (Print-on-Demand sanity)

* Choose providers with **low breakage** and reliable packaging; test samples (11oz/15oz).
* **Order routing** on (with a small extra-cost cap) to keep orders moving.
* Only claim **dishwasher/microwave** safety if your provider explicitly supports it; mirror in FAQ/description.

---

## 7) Minimal KPI Set (watch weekly)

* **Listings with all attributes filled:** aim \~100%. 
* **13 unique tags** per active listing. 
* **Views → Faves → Orders** per listing (conversion trend).
* **On-time dispatch & response speed** (protects ranking potential).

## 8) 7-Day Quick Start

1. Rewrite **10 titles** to the 2025 style (noun + 1–3 traits).
2. Fill **all attributes** on those 10 listings (capacity/material/finish/personalization/recipient/occasion). 
3. Refresh to **13 unique tags** each (long-tails + synonyms; no attribute/category repeats). 
4. Fix the **first 2–3 description lines** (natural phrases, no lists). 
5. Upgrade **hero photos** and add a **5–15s** demo. 
6. Run a **Search Visibility** pass; apply 1–2 recommendations. 
7. Prototype one **new niche** (pets/occupation/year) → publish 2–3 test listings.
