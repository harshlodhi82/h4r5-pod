# Etsy 2025 Playbook (Printify Seller) ‚Äì README

**Goal:** get seen in Etsy search, turn clicks into sales, and run smooth Printify ops.

---

## 0) TL;DR ‚Äî Do This First

1. **Pick a niche** ‚Üí write down 3 buyer intents (e.g., ‚Äú1995 mug‚Äù, ‚Äúcustom name mug‚Äù, ‚Äúdad birthday mug‚Äù).
2. **Launch 12 discovery listings** (4 per intent). Each listing = unique design + distinct photos.
3. **Front-load the exact long-tail** in the title. Mirror it in tags + attributes. Add a 5‚Äì15s video.
4. **Use free shipping logic** (e.g., US Free Shipping Guarantee on \$35+). Bake shipping into price.
5. **Turn on Share & Save** and use the trackable link in your bios/posts (IG/Pinterest/YouTube).
6. **Enable Printify Order Routing** with a small max extra-cost cap. Prefer providers near buyers.
7. **Check metrics weekly** (CTR, conversion, favorites, ATCs, messages). Improve your best 2‚Äì3 intents with **+6 listings** by weeks 3‚Äì4.
8. **Hit Star Seller behaviors**: reply fast, ship on time, keep reviews high, keep policies clear.

---

## 1) Simple Success Metrics (check weekly)

* **Views ‚Üí CTR ‚Üí Favorites ‚Üí Conversion Rate** per listing
* **Add-to-carts (ATCs)** and **messages** (strong intent signals)
* **Search Visibility** warnings (missing attributes/tags, weak media)
* **Ops**: time to ship, defect/damage rate, response rate

**Healthy starting targets:** CTR 2‚Äì3% ‚Ä¢ Conversion 2‚Äì4% (giftable items) ‚Ä¢ Reply <24h (95%+) ‚Ä¢ On-time ship 95%+

---

## 2) How Etsy Search Works (plain English)

* **Match:** Etsy first finds listings that match the shopper‚Äôs words. Your **title, tags, categories, and attributes** matter here.
* **Rank:** Etsy then sorts matched listings. **Clicks, conversion, reviews, on-time shipping, fast replies, and solid policies** help you rank higher.

**Takeaway:** every listing must target **one clear search intent** and make it easy for shoppers to click and buy.

---

## 3) Shop Branding & Trust (quick wins)

* **Logo + banner:** clean, consistent style.
* **About section:** 3‚Äì5 sentences: who you are, what you make, why it‚Äôs special.
* **FAQ:** care instructions, personalization rules, processing times, replacements.
* **Policies:** clear shipping, returns/reprints, timelines, international notes.
* **Shop announcement:** shipping promos, deadlines, or seasonal info.
* **Visual consistency:** similar lighting/backgrounds across listings builds trust.

---

## 4) Listing Plan by Niche

### Phase 1 ‚Äî Discovery (Days 1‚Äì14)

* Make **12 listings**: choose **3 intents**, create **4 unique listings** per intent.
* Keep size/color as **variations** inside a listing (reviews & favorites consolidate).

### Phase 2 ‚Äî Double-Down (Weeks 3‚Äì4)

* Add **+6 listings** on the **2‚Äì3 best** intents (highest views/favorites/ATCs).
* Expand to longer phrases (e.g., ‚Äú1995 mug‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äú1995 birthday mug for dad‚Äù).

### Phase 3 ‚Äî Scale (Month 2+)

* Grow to **30‚Äì50 listings per niche**, each meaningfully different (design/intent/audience).
* Avoid near duplicates. Each listing should feel like a **new door** into your shop.

---

## 5) SEO: Titles, Tags, Categories, Attributes

**Title formula (front-load the main phrase):**

```
{Primary long-tail} ‚Äì {Recipient/Occasion} | {Material/Style} | {Personalized/Year/Name}
```

**Example:** `Custom Year Mug ‚Äì 1995 Birthday Gift for Men | 11oz/15oz Ceramic | Personalized Name`

**Tags (use all 13 ‚Äî mix exact phrase + variants):**

```
1995 mug, custom year mug, personalized birthday mug, gift for him, ceramic coffee cup,
name mug, retro 90s mug, dad birthday gift, 11oz mug, 15oz mug, printed mug,
dishwasher safe, gift under 25
```

**Categories & attributes (don‚Äôt skip):**

* **Recipient** (dad/mom/teacher), **Occasion** (birthday/anniversary), **Holiday** (Christmas/Father‚Äôs Day),
* **Material** (ceramic), **Capacity** (11oz/15oz), **Color**, **Style/Pattern**, **Production method**.

> Tip: attributes act like **extra tags**.

---

## 6) Photos & Video (clicks + conversion)

* **Photo 1 (Hero):** front on white, sharp, tight crop.
* **Photo 2 (Lifestyle):** in context (desk/kitchen/hand).
* **Photo 3 (Scale):** show size (hand-held or ruler).
* **Photo 4 (Personalization):** where to enter the text + example.
* **Photo 5 (Packaging):** shows ‚Äúgift-ready‚Äù.
* **Video (5‚Äì15s):** quick spin or personalization demo.

---

## 7) Pricing, Shipping & Offers

* **Free shipping logic:** If you use US Free Shipping Guarantee (\$35+), roll shipping into price.
* **Coupons:**

  * Automated: **abandoned cart** & **favorited item** (10‚Äì15% is a common test).
  * **Flash sales** on slow movers (limit to 72h).
* **Make an Offer (if eligible):** cap max discount (e.g., 15%) to protect margins.
* **Share & Save:** always post with your **trackable link** for a fee credit (check current % in Etsy; it can change).

**Ads (quick take):**

* **Etsy Ads (onsite PPC):** start small (\$2‚Äì5/day). Keep only listings with strong CTR/conversion. Pause if ACoS (ad spend √∑ sales) is too high for your margins.
* **Offsite Ads:** Etsy may require them after a certain annual revenue threshold. Under/over the threshold fees differ. **Check your shop settings** for current rules.

---

## 8) Reviews & Social Proof Flywheel

* **After delivery:** send a friendly message (template below) asking for a review/photo.
* **Feature UGC:** if allowed, put the best buyer photo in image slot #2 or #3.
* **Respond to reviews:** thank happy buyers; reply calmly to issues and offer fixes.

**Review request template:**

> Hi {First Name}! Hope you loved your {product}. If you have a minute, a quick review (a photo helps others) really supports our small shop. Thank you! üôè

---

## 9) Messages & Customer Service (Star Seller)

* **Reply to 95% of messages in <24h.**
* **Confirm personalization** (if unclear) before production.
* **Order update message:** send tracking + any care tips.
* **Problem handling:** ask for photos; reprint/refund quickly if damaged/defective.

**Quick message templates:**

**A) Personalization check**

> Thanks for your order! I‚Äôll print exactly: ‚Äú{Text}‚Äù. Is that correct (case/spelling)? I‚Äôll start as soon as you confirm.

**B) Tracking**

> Your order is on the way üéâ Tracking: {link}. Let me know if you need anything.

**C) Issue**

> I‚Äôm sorry for the trouble. Please share photos of the item + packaging. I‚Äôll arrange a reprint or refund right away.

## 10) Printify Playbook (quality & speed)

**Provider selection:**

* Choose providers near your main markets (US/EU/UK/AU).

**Order Routing:**
